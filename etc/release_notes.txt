Chakra - 2010-08-17 - Build: 0817-k450-gf
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Chakra Developement Team is proud to announce the availability of Ashoc Preview4

In this a brand new development-release with KDE SC 4.5.0
Over 1000 packages are now available for our new Distribution and over 500 get 
installed by this media.

This is the second full build of KDE SC 4.5.0 so it might more stable now. 
Consider this image as testing. I removed the fbsplash settings to not confuse new 
users totally.

Also we have two new themes. Crunchy Branch and a reworked Ashoc. Tell me what you
think of them ...

Test this build and report back in our forum.
Please don't use this image for productive use.

Build-Notes

GTK2+

This image is gtk2 free, so you will miss flashplugin in this image. Also you can't
start nvidia-settings since that also needs gtk2. Use nvidia-xconfig instead.
You can always install missing packages with pacman from our repositories.
